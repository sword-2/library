## Comments

The content tries to be another option to read selected scriptures. The initial repo is just a King James Version (kjv) plain text which was reformatted from a large Gutenberg file a few years back. It probably doesn't conform to the SWORD project verse per line (vpl) format, but does vpl concepts. The references below identify some other bible texts and OSIS files advertised on the internet since this isn't the first repo. The SWORD project already published Project KJV2006 also listed in the references, and that page cautioned about some ill-formed XML. No attempt was made to convert this to OSIS because there were textual criticism questions described more in the [doxygen](https://sword-2.github.io/library/html/html/index.html). If the textual criticism is figured out, a shell script in the repo might be modified to convert text to OSIS.

If someone decided to attempt to read the KJV version on this repo, a download/clone to the local device is the first step. If the content needs to be unzipped or extracted, that is another step. Then keep the kjv folder but delete the other folders to remove reader clutter. It is hoped that a file manager and common text file viewer may then enable random access of KJV scriptures by selecting the folder for the desired bible book and the file for the chapter number.
