## Comments

The content hopes to be another option to read selected scriptures like other bibles. The initial repo is just a King James Version (kjv) plain text which was reformatted from a large Gutenberg file. It probably doesn't conform to the SWORD project verse per line (vpl) format, but does vpl concepts. The SWORD project already published Project KJV2006 listed in the references below, and that page cautioned about some ill-formed XML in the content. The shell script on this repo is expected to be modifiable as an option to again convert plain text from Gutenberg to Open Scriptures Information Standard (OSIS) format. It likely just requires some work. But no work was attempted yet due to questions about text accuracy ...

There were some minor questions about having the exact same text when comparing [reformatted] Gutenberg content with biblegateway.com for kjv. This was described more in the [doxygen](https://sword-2.github.io/library/html/html/index.html).

If someone decided to attempt to read the KJV version on this repo, a download/clone to the local device is the first step. If the content needs to be unzipped or extracted, that is another step. Then keep the kjv folder but delete the other folders to remove reader clutter. It is hoped that a file manager and common text file viewer may then enable random access of KJV scriptures by selecting the folder for the desired bible book and the file for the chapter number.
