## Comments

The content hopes to be another option to read selected scriptures like other bibles. The initial repo is just a King James Version (kjv) plain text which was reformatted from a large Gutenberg file. It probably doesn't conform to the SWORD project verse per line (vpl) format, but does vpl concepts. While the SWORD project already published a kjv [OSIS file](https://sword-2.github.io/library/html/html/index.html), for some reason (?operator error) it didn't always open in a web browser like other xml files. A shell script on this repo is expected to be modifiable to convert the plain text from Gutenberg to a simple Open Scriptures Information Standard (OSIS) format.

When the repo is downloaded, a file manager and common text file viewer may enable random access by selecting the the desired bible book and chapter number. Apps can be cool, but the file manager access method initially avoids app installs, software buttons, menus, and reading help files for an app. Gutenberg files are excellent, but in the past some were big and this repo tried to split up the content.

There are minor questions about having the exact same text when comparing [reformatted] Gutenberg content with biblegateway.com for kjv. This was described more in the [doxygen](https://sword-2.github.io/library/html/html/index.html).
