## Comments

The content hopes to eventually be an option to read scriptures like other bibles. It is initially is limited to King James Version (kjv) plain text. The next paragraph touches upon accuracy. When the repo is downloaded, a file manager may enable random access by selecting the the desired bible book and chapter number. The file manager access method initially avoids app installs, software buttons, menus, and training to use the app.

Most of the description was put in [doxygen](https://sword-2.github.io/library/html/html/index.html).
