## Comments

The kjv folder reformatted scriptures for personal use and also for preparing to apply automation. The kjv acronym is for a King James Version (KJV) plain text bible which was reformatted from another organization.

At this time, the KJV file format probably doesn't conform to the SWORD project verse per line (vpl). But it does similar concepts. Personal use reading was done by downloading/cloning content to the local [mobile] device and then unzipping or extracting the content. Then a file manager/explorer was used to open text files for the desired chapter. The chapter is selected in the kjv folder by clicking on a book folder and then a chapter file number. 

How to download? In the past, a download button was remembered on github. But recently this was no longer observed on a mobile device browser. Thus, another [web site](https://downgit.github.io/) was used to download the repo to the local device.

## Text accuracy

A [doxygen](https://sword-2.github.io/library/html/html/index.html) file describes the estimated accuracy of these scriptures. Partial checking was done thus far.

## Other projects

This repo is not the first to attempt to supply bible text. The list below identifies some more supplies, but is not complete. It is possible this repo may make it easier to browse simple text for kjv without installing a new app.
