## Comments

The kjv folder reformatted scriptures for personal use and for preparing to apply automation. The kjv acronym is for a King James Version (KJV) plain text bible which was reformatted from another organization.

At this time, the KJV file format probably doesn't conform to the SWORD project verse per line (vpl). But it does similar concepts. Personal use reading was done by downloading/cloning content to the local [mobile] device and then unzipping or extracting the content. Then a file manager/explorer was used to open text files for the desired chapter. The chapter is selected in the kjv folder by clicking on a book folder and then a chapter file number. 

How to download? In the past, a download button was remembered on github. But recently this was no longer observed on a mobile device browser. Thus, another [web site](https://downgit.github.io/) was used to download the repo to the local device.

## Text accuracy

A [doxygen](https://sword-2.github.io/library/html/html/index.html) file is still in progress to describe differences observed between the Gutenberg and biblegateway scriptures as a way to sanity check the repo content is OK. 

## Other projects

The bible text was certainly not the first on the internet. In addition to Gutenberg, biblegateway, etc, the list below found a few more efforts.
1. [Project KJV2006](https://www.crosswire.org/~dmsmith/kjv2006/)
2. [Sefaria](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Export/tree/master/txt/Tanakh)
3. [gratis-bible](https://github.com/gratis-bible/bible)
