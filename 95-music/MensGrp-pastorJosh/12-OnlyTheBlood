<h3 id='12'>Only the Blood</h3>

Holiness is you life in me<br>
Making me clean through you blood<br>
Holiness is your fire in me<br>
Purging my heart like a flood<br>
I know, You are, perfect in holiness<br>
Your life, in me, setting me free, making me holy<br>
<br>

Only the blood of Jesus, covers all of my sin<br>
Only the life of Jesus, renews me from within<br>
Your blood is enough, Your mercy complete<br>
Your work of atonement, paid for my debts, making me holy<br>
Only the blood of Jesus<br>
