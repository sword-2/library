<h3 id='10'>Psalm 62</h3>

Only in God is my soul at rest<br>
In Him is my salvation<br>
He only is my rock<br>
My strength and my salvation<br>
<br>

<i>Chorus<br>
My stronghold, my Savior<br>
I will not be ashamed at all<br>
My stronghold, my Savior<br>
I will not be moved</i><br>
<br>

Only in God is found safety when<br>
The enemy pursues me<br>
Only in God is found glory when<br>
I'm found weak and lowly<br>
