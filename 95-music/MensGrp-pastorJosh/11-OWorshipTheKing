<h3 id='11'>O Worship the King</h3>

O worship the King, all glorious above<br>
and gratefully sing His wonderful love
<br>
Our shield and defender, the Ancient of Days<br>
Pavilioned in splendor, and girded with praise<br>
<br>

O tell of His might, O sing of His grace<br>
Whose robe is the light and canopy space<br>
Hi chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form<br>
And Dark is His path on the wings of the storm<br>
<br>

<i>Chorus<br>
You alone are the matchless King<br>
To you alone be all majesty<br>
Your glories and wonders, what tongue can recite<br>
You breathe in the air, You shine in the light</i><br>
<br>

O measureless might, ineffable love<br>
While angels delight to worship above<br>
Thy mercies how tender, how firm to the end<br>
Our maker, defender, redeemer and friend<br>
