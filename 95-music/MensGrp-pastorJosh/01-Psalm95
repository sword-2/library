<h3 id='1'>Psalm 95</h3>

Come let us worship and bow down<br>
Let us kneel before the Lord our God our Maker<br>
Come let us worship and bow down<br>
Let us kneel before the Lord our God our Maker
<br><br>

For He is our God<br>
And we are the people of His pasture<br>
And the sheep of His hands<br>
Just the sheep of His hands<br>
