<h3 id='13'>The Wonderful Cross</h3>

When I survey the wondrous cross<br>
On which the Prince of glory died<br>
My richest gain I count by loss<br>
And pour contempt on all my pride<br>
<br>

See from His head, His hands, His feet
<br>
Sorrow and love flow mingled down<br>
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet<br>
Or thorns compose so rich a crown<br>
<br>

<i>Chorus:<br>
Oh the wonderful cross, oh the wonderful cross<br>
Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live<br>
Oh the wonderful cross, oh the wonderful cross<br>
All who gather hear by grace draw near and bless Your name</i><br>
<br>

Were the whole realm of nature mine<br>
That were a present far too small<br>
Love so amazing, so divine<br>
Demands my soul, my life, my all<br>
