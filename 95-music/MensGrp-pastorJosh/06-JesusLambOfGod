<h3 id='6'>Jesus Lamb of God</h3>

You are my strength when I am weak, You are the treasure that I seek<br>
You are my all in all<br>
seeking you as a precious jewel, Lord to give up I'd be a fool<br>
You are my all in all<br>
<br>

<i>Chorus<br>
Jesus Lamb of God, worthy is Your name
<br>
Jesus Lamb of God, worthy is Your name
</i><br>
<br>

Taking my sin my cross my shame, rising again I bless your name<br>
Your are my all in all<br>
When I fall down you pick me up, when I am dry you fill my cup<br>
Your are my all in all<br>
