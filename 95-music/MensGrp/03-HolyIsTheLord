<h3 id='3'>Holy is the Lord</h3>

We stand and lift up our hands<br>
For the joy of the Lord is our strength<br>
We bow down and worship Him now<br>
How great, how awesome is He<br>
And together we sing, everyone sing<br>
<br>

<i>Chorus<br>
Holy is the Lord, God Almighty<br>
The earth is filled with His glory<br>
Holy is the Lord, God Almighty<br>
The earth is filled with His glory<br>
The earth is filled with His glory</i><br>
<br>

And it's rising up all around<br>
It's the anthem of the Lord's renown (2X)<br>
<br>

And together we sing, everyone sing<br>
Holy is the Lord, God Almighty<br>
The earth is filled with His glory<br>
Holy is the Lord, God Almighty<br>
The earth is filled with His glory<br>
The earth is filled with His glory<br>
