<h3 id='7'>Light of the World</h3>

Light of the world You stepped down into darkness<br>
Open my eyes let me see<br>
Beauty that made this heart adore You<br>
Hope of a life spent with You<br>
<br>

<i>Chorus
So here I am to worship, here I am to bow down<br>
Here I am to say that You're my God<br>
You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy<br>
Altogether wonderful to me</i><br>
<br>

King of all days, O o highly exalted<br>
Glorious in heaven above<br>
Humbly You came to the earth You created<br>
All for love's sake became poor<br>
<br>

<i>Tag<br>
I'll never know how much it cost<br>
To see my sin upon that cross (2X)
