<h3 id='14'>Revelation Song</h3>

Worthy is the Lamb who was slain<br>
Holy Holy is He<br>
Sing a new song to Him who sits on<br>
Heavens mercy seat<br>
<br>

<i>Chorus<br>
Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord God almighty<br>
Who was and is and is to come<br>
With all creation I sing, praise to the King of kings<br>
You are my everything and I will adore you</i><br>
<br>

Clothed in rainbows of living color<br>
Flashes of lightening rolls of thunder<br>
Blessing and honor strength and glory and power be<br>
To you the only wise King<br>
<br>

Filled with wonder awestruck wonder<br>
At the mention of your name<br>
Jesus you name is power breath and living water<br>
What a marvelous mystery<br>
