<h3 id='9'>LORD Jehovah</h3>

The heavens declare Your glory, they proclaim your mighty works<br>
With a word You made them, Creator of the earth<br>
The whole earth is full of Your glory oh LORD<br>
<br>

Your are the God of mercy, Sustainer of all that is seen<br>
You are the great Provider, Giver of everything<br>
The whole earth is full of Your glory, O Lord<br>
<br>

<i><u>Chorus (2X)</u><br>
Lord Jehovah we bow at your throne<br>
singing glory and honor and praise</i><br>
<br>

You are the God of salvation, mighty are your ways<br>
You are the God of redemption, Holy Ancient of Days<br>
The whole earth is full of Your glory, O Lord<br>
