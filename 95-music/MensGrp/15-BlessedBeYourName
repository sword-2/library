<h3 id='15'>Blessed be Your Name</h3>

Blessed be Your name<br>
In the land that is plentiful<br>
Where streams of abundance flow<br>
Blessed be Your name<br>
<br>

Blessed be Your name<br>
When the sun's shining down on me<br>
When the world's all that it should be<br>
Blessed be Your name<br>
<br>

<i>Chorus<br>
Every blessing You pour out, I'll turn back to praise<br>
When the darkness closes in Lord, still I will say<br>
Blessed be the name of the Lord, blessed be Your name<br>
Blessed be the name of the Lord, blessed be Your glorious name</i><br>
<br>

Blessed be Your name<br>
When I'm found in the desert place<br>
When I walk through the wilderness<br>
Blessed be Your name<br>
<br>

Blessed be Your Name<br>
On the road marked with suffering<br>
Through there's pain in the offering<br>
Blessed be Your name<br>
<br>

<i>You Give and take away, You give and take away<br>
My heart will choose to say, Lord blessed be Your name</i>
