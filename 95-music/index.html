<h3 id='5'>In Christ Alone</h3>

In Christ alone, my hope is found, He is my light my strength my song<br>
This cornerstone this solid ground firm through the fiercest drought & storm<br>
What heights of love, what depths of peace, when fears are stilled, when strivings cease.<br>
My comforter, my all in all, here in the love of Christ I stand<br>
<br>

In Christ alone, who took of flesh, fullness of God in helpless babe<br>
This gift of love, and righteousness, scorned by the ones He came to save<br>
Till on the cross as Jesus died, the wrath of God was satisfied<br>
For every sin on Him was laid, here in the death of Christ I live<br>
<br>

There in the ground His body lay, light of the world, by darkness slain<br>
Then bursting forth, in glorious day, up from the grave He rose again<br>
And as He stands in victory, sin's curse has lost its grip on me<br>
For I am His and He is mine, bought with the precious blood of Christ<br>

Hope of a life spent with You<br>

Here I am to say that You're my God<br>
You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy<br>
Altogether wonderful to me</i><br>

When I survey the wondrous cross<br>
On which the Prince of glory died<br>
My richest gain I count by loss<br>
And pour contempt on all my pride<br>

Did e'er such love and sorrow meet<br>
Or thorns compose so rich a crown<br>

Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live<br>
