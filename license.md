# license

## Bible Content
No license for content, but it is still being checked for correct copying. The content came from Gutenberg which identified no restriction.   

## Software Copyright
Copyright ADOM Baptist Church Ghana (pastor Alex) and affiliated Companies.    
Although the content essentially did not have a license, issues occurred during reformatting. For example, lines were broken up and thousands of Windows &copy; characters appeared when the bible file was brought over into a Linux system.
Some software programs were being made to help verify the content. Counting or matching verses was the first check.
