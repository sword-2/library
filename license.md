A lot of the initial input was free or unlicensed, but the initial inputs were not completed allowing a chance for copyright on the extra parts.  

Although the original KJV bible was not copyrighted, nearly every line and verse was not structured properly. Everything had to be rechecked. Extra characters were removed probably because some files converted from Windows to Linux.
Verses had be split across lines, which did not meet basic grammar standards. Also, some verses had merged back together or were never separated.   

Software was being used to go back and check the content.   

As content forms up from extra editing and processing, the extra is getting copyright ADOM Baptist Church Ghana (pastor Alex) and affiliated Companies.
