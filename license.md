# license
A lot of the initial input was free or unlicensed, but some of the initial inputs were not complete. When complete, the idea was to distribute (Matt 28:19-20), but also the extra effort for incomplete portions allowed a chance for copyright.  

Although the original KJV bible was not copyrighted, nearly every line and verse was not structured properly in the text processing system used. Nearly everything had to be reformatted which then leads to more checking. Verses had been split across lines, which would not meet basic grammar standards. Also, some verses had merged together or never had a chance to be separated by lines in the first place. The references were not always at the start of a line, but varied in location.

## brefspec file:
Extra characters were removed for end of line - ^M. Adding a ^M to the verse reference changed the references so they would not match the ones in the bible, which did not have ^M. This was assumed to occur because a file was converted from Windows to Linux.

## Software
Software was being coded to repair formatting and also check the content.  The book of Leviticus was manually formatted, but code is planned to repair the other books.

## Copyright
Copyright ADOM Baptist Church Ghana (pastor Alex) and affiliated Companies. They have a least 1 ministry that does crafts to sell for poor persons.

# Appendix 2 - software change
The original software intended for checking had a lot of good features for other applications. 
But due to perceived anomalies, a user agreement was begun to be fair (Pr 2:9) about anomalies to potential recipients. This was counted as part of the inputs not being complete.
However, an agreement was abandoned upon hearing software and languages already deployed out to global locations, like at least one orphanage. And the anomalies became overwhelming, so the language was changed to bash scripts.
Any agreement would be too late, showing after the software already left for new customers.
