# bible-kjv
It is not complete and not checked to avoid errors.

**Plan**  
It is planned to be a KJV bible accessible by simple file-system. Some extra folders might be added for support material.  

One extra folder was added for messages from the original download, a Gutenberg file "10.zip" (Reference 1). The particular download was one giant file. Part of this repository was splitting the giant file into smaller parts for random access.  

There are already lots of bible apps, but a file-system format also makes for easy addition of tools like concordance, maybe coloring pages if a child downloaded, etc. 

**Caution: not yet checked for accidental errors.**
