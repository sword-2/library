It is not complete and not checked to avoid errors.

**Plan**  
It is planned to be a KJV bible accessible by simple file-system. Some extra folders might be added for support material.  

One extra folder has notices from the original Gutenberg file "10.zip" (Reference 1). That particular download was one giant file now being split into smaller parts for random access.   

A specification for bible verses was found, reference 2. 
This was also divided up and the parts for each bible book placed into the folder. The original name brefspec was kept.
Only about half the spec was divided up. It had more content for specific bible versions or books past Revelation, but the extra was skipped.

**Caution: accidental errors.**  

While coding, potential anomalies in how the software runs were perceived. 
In the interest to consider others (Phil 2:3-4, etc), some code was prepared for an agreement regarding possible anomalies and risks, to prepare any operators, even international browsers, to be able to decline risk. 
But the agreement was abandoned due to being late on the software scene. Some reports said software and languages had already deployed out to global locations, like an orphanage. Having already gotten out, it was not practical to meditate on the past and how there should have been some agreement.
