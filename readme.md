#bible-kjv

It is not complete and not checked to avoid errors.

**Plan**
It is planned to be a KJV bible so that when the .zip format is downloaded, it will expand into a file system formby books and chapters, etc.

A Gutenberg (Reference 1) download was acquired. The particular file downloaded and unzipped into one giant file.

The giant file is only being separated by books, chapters, and administrative parts.

It is just personal file processing, not completed and probably has accidental errors. When content is checked, the check will be described.
