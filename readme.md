#bible-kjv

The repository is not yet complete. It is planned to be a KJV bible in a file system format.
A file system offers more random access to select specific books and chapters than one large file.

The content will just be a copy from the Gutenberg (Reference 1) web page. The Gutenberg was really cool to offer a download. The downloaded which was unzipped was one giant file.

Therefore dividing the giant file to separate books, chapters, and administrative parts. The git command line tool was good for upload and download of whole file systems, thus a plan to apply it.   

It is just a personal file processing and accidental errors may occur. Any checking will be added once done.
