It is not complete and not checked to avoid errors.

**Plan**
It is planned to be a KJV bible so that when the .zip format is downloaded, it will expand into a file system format for books and chapters, etc.

A Gutenberg (Reference 1) download was acquired. The particular downloaded into one giant unzipped file.

The giant file is only being separated by books, chapters, and administrative parts.

It is just personal file processing, not completed and probably accidental errors. When content is checked, the check will be described.
