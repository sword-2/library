It is not reliable yet.

**Plan**  
It is planned to be a KJV bible accessible by simple file-system. Like appendices, some extra folders might be added for support material.

The scripture content came from a Gutenberg file "10.zip" (Reference 1). That particular download was one giant file. Although good, the 'git' protocol was capable of breaking the large file to the separate books and chapters. This hoped to help a browser navigate it easier by random access.    
 
**Caution: accidental errors.**  

A folder with software to verify contents exists too with the intent to minimize accidental errors.
