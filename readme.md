It is not complete and not checked to avoid errors.

**Plan**
It is planned to be a KJV bible accessible by simple file-system. The .zip download is planned to expand into folders for each book, and inside that, files for each chapter.

It started out from a Gutenberg download (Reference 1). The particular download was good, but one giant file. The giant file would be harder to navigate.

There are already lots of bible apps, but a file-system format makes for easy addition of tools like concordance, maybe coloring pages if a child downloaded, etc.

**Caution: not yet checked for accidental errors.**
