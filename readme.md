It is not complete and not checked to avoid errors.

**Plan**  
It is planned to be a KJV bible accessible by simple file-system. Some extra folders might be added for support material.  

One extra folder has notices from the original Gutenberg file "10.zip" (Reference 1). That particular download was one giant file now being split into smaller parts for random access.   

A specification for bible verses was found, reference 2. 
This was also divided up and the parts for each bible book placed into the folder. The original name brefspec was kept.
Only about half the spec was divided up. It had more content for specific bible versions or books past Revelation, but the extra was skipped.

**Caution: accidental errors.**  

While coding, an original purpose was to supply software code the user could run to statistical validate the verses. But in the process, potential anomalies in a software language were perceived.
Therefore the language was switched to a different one that is not easily user run-able.
When perceiving anomalies, a user agreement was considered to be fair (Pr 2:9). However, this was abandoned upon hearing software and languages already deployed out to global locations, like an orphanage. To be practical, the agreement would have to precede deployment, but was too late.
