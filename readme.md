#bible-kjv

The repository is not yet complete. It is planned to be a KJV bible in a file system format.
A file system offers more random access to select specific books and chapters.

The content was just a copy from the Gutenberg (Reference 1) web page. The Gutenberg was really cool to offer a download. However, when the file was downloaded and unzipped, it was one giant file.

Therefore dividing the giant file to separate books, chapters, and administrative parts. File system uploads and downloads was one ability of the git command line tool, thus a plan to apply it.   

It is just a personal file processing and not yet checked to avoid accidental errors.
