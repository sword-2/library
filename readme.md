#bible-kjv

It is not complete and not checked to avoid errors.

**Plan**
It is planned to be a KJV bible so that when the .zip format is downloaded, will expand into a file system format by books and chapters, etc.

It started out from a Gutenberg download (Reference 1). The particular file unzipped into one giant file. That giant file is being separated by books, chapters, and administrative parts.

It is just personal file processing, not completed and likely has accidental errors.
