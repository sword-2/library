It is not complete and not checked to avoid errors.

**Plan**  
It is planned to be a KJV bible accessible by simple file-system. Some extra folders might be added for support material.  

One extra folder has notices from the original Gutenberg file "10.zip" (Reference 1). That particular download was one giant file now being split into smaller parts for random access.   

A specification for bible verses was found, reference 2. 
This was also divided up and the parts for each bible book placed into the folder. The original name brefspec was kept.
Only about half the spec was divided up. It had more content for specific bible versions or books past Revelation, but the extra was skipped.

**Caution: accidental errors.**  

While coding, potential anomalies in how the software runs were perceived. Code for an agreement regarding possible anomalies and language translation was deactivated due to being late on the software field. Reports said software/languages were already deployed out to global locations like an orphanage so the late arrival of this code doesn't really matter.
