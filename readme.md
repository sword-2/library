It is not complete and not checked to avoid errors.

**Plan**  
It is planned to be a KJV bible accessible by simple file-system. Some extra folders might be added for support material.  

One extra folder has notices from the original Gutenberg file "10.zip" (Reference 1). That particular download was one giant file now being split into smaller parts for random access.   

A specification for bible verses was found, reference 2. 
This was also divided up and the parts for each bible book placed into the folder. The original name brefspec was kept.
Only about half the spec was divided up. It had more content for specific bible versions or books past Revelation, but the extra was skipped.

**Caution: accidental errors.**  

While coding, potential risks were perceived. An agreement to accept them was removed after perceiving they were overcome by events (OBE).  
There were reports our software in related systems had already crossed our border(s) and deployed to at least some orphanages around the globe. Therefore if any risks were valid, it no longer mattered as the software already went without any agreements, consultation, or child protection policy (orphanage).
