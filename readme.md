It is not reliable yet.

**Plan**  
It is planned to be a KJV bible accessible by simple file-system.

The scripture content came from a Gutenberg file "10.zip" (Reference 1). That particular download was one giant file. Although good, the 'git' protocol was capable of breaking the large file to the separate books and chapters. Such random access was one intended benefit.    

**Caution: accidental errors.**  

A folder with software to verify contents exists too with the intent to minimize accidental errors.    

The verses were being moved onto separate lines. This was for reading by some programs that can count line numbers. This might not retain the space efficiency of the original file in a printout.
