It is not complete and not checked to avoid errors.

**Plan**
It is planned to be a KJV bible accessible by simple file-system with some extra folders like appendices. 

The bulk of content started from a Gutenberg download (Reference 1). The particular download was good to supply a whole bible, but it came out in one giant file. The giant file is being split into smaller parts.

There are already lots of bible apps, but a file-system format also makes for easy addition of tools like concordance, maybe coloring pages if a child downloaded, etc. 
Maybe a script will be added to assemble the books and chapters back like the original giant file?

**Caution: not yet checked for accidental errors.**
