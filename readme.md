It is not complete and not proof-read.

**Plan**  
It is planned to be a KJV bible accessible by simple file-system. Some extra folders might be added for support material. But content is not reliable yet. 

The scripture content came from a Gutenberg file "10.zip" (Reference 1). That particular download was one giant file. For easier random access, it is being split into smaller parts.   

A specification for bible verses was found, reference 2. This file was modified in a few ways, per appendix 1. 

**Caution: accidental errors.**  

A folder (99-bash_script) has scripts being developed for formatting and checking.

# Appendix 1 - mods to brefspec file
The brefspec file was divided up and the parts for each bible book placed into the corresponding folder. The original name brefspec was kept but with a "999-" prefix.  
Second, only about half the spec was divided up. It had more content for specific bible versions or books past Revelation, but the extra was skipped.
