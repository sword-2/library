//
// Description: 
//
// 	This file contains the specifcation of the Bible reference conversions.
//
//  Tips for entering book specifications:
//
//	1) Keep all of the verses for a chapter together.  For example, in the
//     NAB book of Esther, apocryphal chapters are inserted in the middle
//     of the other chapters resulting in those chapters being broken up.
//     For instance, chapter B is inserted between verse 13 and 14 of 
//     chapter 3.  When this happens, specify all of chapter 3 and then
//     all of chapter B but don't split chapter 3 in the specification.
//
//	2) Numbered chapters and verses must be specified in numerical order
//     even if they are not that way in the printed Bible.  For instance,
//     there are some books that re-arrange the numbered verses like:
//     1, 2, 4, 3, ...  Specify these in numerical order not printed order.
//     The reason for this is that the program will attempt to check for 
//     verse that were accidentally left out or numbered wrong.
//
//	3) If a verse number is skipped by the book, specify an entry for the
//     missed verse number with "SKIP" as its label.  The NRSV sometimes
//     skips verse numbers like this:  1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 ...  This should
//     be specified like this:
//
//			95:12:1
//			95:12:2
//			95:12:3
//			95:12:4
//			95:12:SKIP
//			95:12:6
//			95:12:7
//			95:12:SKIP
//			95:12:9
//
//     This is because, as stated before, the program will flag any interruptions
//     in verse numbering as a problem and because the internal data tables 
//     must have an entry for all numbers even if they are skipped so that a
//     verse number can be used as an index into the table.
//
//	4) Use the NEAR keyword to identify aliases for a verse that are not direct
//     equivalents for the verse but are near where this verses is in another
//     translation that does not have this verse but has other verses that are
//     near this one in this translation.  For instance, Daniel with apocrypha
//	   has the same verses in chapter 3 as the KJV Daniel but adds a bunch of
//     verses between verses 23 and 24 from the KJV.  Therefore, those apocryphal
//     verses can say they have no direct alias in the KJV Daniel but are near
//     verse 23.
//
//	5) Use the MAKE_CHAPTER_LABEL in front of lines with a chapter that is a
//     number but is out of sequence with the previous chapter on purpose.  In
//     the NRSV with Apocrypha translation, the apocryphal additions are added
//     before chapter 1, between chapter 3 and 4, and between chapter 8 and 9
//     but are given the numbers 11-16.  Therefore, they must be treated like
//     labeled chapters so they don't have to be in numeric order.

//	10-04-95 09:37 kao made corrections
//	10-10-95 14:25 jwo fixed some of the comments
//	11-01-95 11:55 jwo rearranged NRSV Esther (book 95) so chapters 11-16
//                     come where they do in the printed book
//				   jwo also fixed some of the mappings between 88, 95, 100
//	12-07-95 17:31 jwo corrected Judith
//	02-02-96 09:24 jwo changed Letter of Jeremiah so that instead of 
//					   skipping the first 6 chapters it makes all of the
//					   entries in chapter 6 as non-numeric chapter labels
//					   so it doesn't matter that the book starts with
//					   chapter 6
