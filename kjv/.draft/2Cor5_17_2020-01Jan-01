The verse 2 Cor 5:17 was used as the verse for the new year.
We don't need new year's resolutions as we can turn from sin daily.

-Mr Pat Read something from a page about new years and Jesus. https://rightfromthe heart.org/devotions/

Look at some scripture:
  *Matt 6:34 - we're not guaranteed a tomorrow, focus on today.
  *Job 12:10 - don't try to be Lord of your own life.
  *John 15:5 - pray for Jesus to be Lord of your life. Walk slower and more purposely in he steps Jesus wants us to walk.
  *Phili 4;6 - are we consistently praying and reading the Word? If you want God to talk to you, you need to be in the Word.
  *Prov 21:1 - 
  *Col 3:1 - understand we're just passing through this world. You can't be effective if the things of this world wear you down. Our brass ring is heaven, not here on earth.
  Road rage is not acting like Jesus. Love the unlovable, even the one cutting you off, to be more like Jesus. We need to work on that.
  
For the new year, I urge you to fall in love with Jesus. He's the Lord and Savior, both, not one or the other.
Are you living with 1 foot in the world and 1 foot in heaven? Jesus says your either for me or against me. 1 foot in each place is like being in hell.
A definition of insanity is doing the same thing the same way and expecting different results. Change and do it different.
