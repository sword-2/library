Discussion before teaching 1 Peter at YP.


I still get nervous teaching. I have to spend 5 minutes not sweating even though it was done many times.
The background and prep can help a lot. If stumbling over yourself mentally it causes nervousness and throws you off.

A few things to balance - method & context.
*Method:
--make observations of the test.
--Ask questions of the text
--Context - very general, who, when, intended audience, themes, where was it written, historical (geographical and time)
*Content: (the hard part is what is conveyed)
--Precepts-God's commands. For example in 1 Pet 1/2 it says to be holy.
--Principles: ideas or concepts that transcend time, like wisdom. As pastor Matteson would say, the principle behind the speed limit is to drive safely.
--Promises: what God says He will do or not do. Sometimes there was not a promose
--themes/topics/subjects/doctrines
--The 3 salvations: 1) justification, 2) sanctification, 3) glorification.
glorification is Christ's return or new bodies. sanctification is living holy. justificatoin - faith, atonements, mercy, 
*Could/would/should/will
--The word is a 2 edged sword; it can 'cut people' but also cut self. Knowing what is there depends on other scripture.
A plot of time versus what was conveyed had could at the top and will at the bottom.
would-if I had 1.5-2 hours to teach-it drops down on the conveyed.
should-this is individual and relational. Everyone should be fed-milk, fruits & veges, meat & potatoes.
Don't leave cookies on the bottom shelf all the time. If in a group of theologians
Next part of the relational part is not biasing the text.
will: data gathering should not exceed 15 hours, but it could be less. 90% gathering stage.

*Prep
--Gather
--Organize
--Review (ed. & memorize). review is key and sometimes I fail. reviewing the day of doesn't work. 
Bare minimum you want everything done by Wednesday.
