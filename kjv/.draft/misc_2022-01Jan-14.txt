Ohana bible study at F.C.C. before a church meeting about supreme court case on abortion.

Why do we read about V.O.M.
2 Cor 1:7-9. Stop relying on self, and rely only on God.
We should feel compassion or sympathy. Sometimes you feel horrible, other times you feel great that they came out of the trial well.
For example, following Natalie - I remember the 1st week after the accident. The elders got together and prayed, Natalie was there on the conference. The elders were in tears praying. There were 9 blocks on the computer and Natalie was one of the bottom blocks.
Dave kept the picture on his computer. Now Natalie can at least walk. She went from not being able to swallow to eating an ice cream cone. We [see] God's hand helping her.
