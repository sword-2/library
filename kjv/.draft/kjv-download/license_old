Stuff cut our of old version of license:


A lot of the initial input was labeled free or unlicensed, but some of the initial inputs were not complete or contained extra things different than the label. When content is complete, the idea was to distribute (Matt 28:19-20). However extra effort to recover anything incomplete or remove extra stuff allowed a chance for copyright.  

Although the original KJV bible was not copyrighted, nearly every line and verse was not structured properly in the text processing system used. Verses had been split across lines, which would not meet basic grammar standards. Also, some verses had merged together or never had a chance to be separated. The verse references were not always at the start of a line, but varied in location. And it looked like there were extra Windows characters. While not visible in basic file viewers, the Linux (bash) text processing discovered what looked like extra Windows characters (^M).

## brefspec file:
Extra characters like Windows characters were also observed in the brefspec file (^M). 

## Software
Software was being coded to repair formatting and also check the content.  The book of Leviticus was partly manually formatted, but code is planned to try and repair faster and do more searches. It would not be efficient to read all the content to see if a Windows character is floating around somewhere as the software might search quicker.


# Appendix 2 - software change
The original software intended for checking verses were in place had a lot of good features for other applications. 
But due to perceived anomalies, a user agreement was begun to be fair (Pr 2:9) about anomalies to potential recipients. Software switching was counted as part of the inputs not exactly prepared.
However, an agreement was abandoned upon hearing software and languages already deployed out to global locations, like at least one orphanage. And the anomalies became overwhelming, so the language was changed to bash scripts.
Any agreement would be too late, showing after the software already left for new customers.
