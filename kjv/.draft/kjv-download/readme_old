# Appendix 1 - mods to brefspec file
The brefspec file was divided up and the parts for each bible book placed into the corresponding folder. The original name brefspec was kept but with a "999-" prefix.  
Second, only about half the spec was divided up. It had more content for specific bible versions or books past Revelation, but the extra was skipped.
