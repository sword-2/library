Samuel Greene's talk on the supreme court abortion case Dec 1, 2021

Gordon commented there are many Christians, Jews, etc that the numbers for life would matter. Samuel Green responded that sadly, many don't hear the truth and then slaughter their own children. Mom, dad, and possibly grandparents may be in anguish in later years. People can also ask God for forgiveness.

Dave N asked about the breakdown of the court at this point. Samuel said its anyone's guess at this point. Some justices may be concerned about how the court will be percieved and may be influenced to act in a way that looks better.

How could the Texas case affect this? Samuel: Texas got more coverage but is not as significant as the Missippi case. Texas argued procedural matters.
