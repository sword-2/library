# Software comments

Because it was faster, software was used to attempt repair of the scripture files. The software is changing.

The numbers for the program prefix are the approximate order.

01-lineFrmt.adom   
This script combined lines which had separated by simple logic to see if the first line was a number for references. It does not work perfect as the referenes were not always located at the start of the line.   

02-rename.adom
The previous script outputs new files with a suffic '-mod' for review. If the -mod files look OK, this script deletes the original filenames and moves the -mod files to the name of the original.


03-references
