	<title>Differences in book names</title>
</head><body> 

Names of many bible books from Gutenberg were shortened. For example, Genesis was used instead of "The First Book of Moses:  Called Genesis". Names remembered from Gutenberg which may have been shortened are listed in table 2.

Some confusion occurred when doing a text search on one book title "The First Book of the Kings" in the Gutenberg etext since multiple results were observed:
	<ul>
		<li>The First Book of Samuel Otherwise Called: The First Book of the Kings</li>
		<li>The First Book of the Kings Commonly Called: The Third Book of the Kings.</li>
	</ul>
