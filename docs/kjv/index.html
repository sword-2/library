	<p>A King James Version (KJV/kjv) plain text bible which was reformatted from a Gutenberg text bible. Goals of reformatting included 1) easier random access using a file manager/explorer, 2) facilitate machine reading of the scriptures using verse per line format, 3) eventually get it into a format used by the SWORD project.</p>

	<p>To minimize accidental errors during the reformatting, some software aids were used to compare the Gutenberg with BibleGateway. The table below divides the results of comparison into a few categories.</p>

<table border=1><caption>Some categories for differences</caption>
	<tr><th>Name / Link</th></tr>
	<tr><td><a href="diff-words.html">differences in words</a></td></tr>
	<tr><td><a href="diff-case.html">differences in case</a></td></tr>
	<tr><td><a href="diff-bookNames.html">shortening the names of books and comments</a></td></tr>

<p>Personal use reading of the repo was done initially by downloading/cloning content to the local [mobile] device and then unzipping or extracting the content. Then a file manager/explorer opened text files for the desired chapter. The chapter is selected in the kjv folder by clicking on a book folder and then a chapter file number.</p> 

<p>How to download? In the past, a download button was remembered on github. But recently this was no longer observed on a mobile device browser. Thus, another <a href="https://downgit.github.io/">web site</a> was used to download the repo to the local device.</p>


<h2>Other projects</h2>

<p>This repo is not the first to attempt to supply bible text. The list below identifies some more supplies, but is not complete. It is possible this repo may make it easier to browse simple text for kjv without installing a new app.</p>

<p>A little amount of software is present in this repo to partially check the integrity of the scriptures. This is a pre-requisite to a bible app which assumes the scriptures are good. A <a href="https://sword-2.github.io/library/html/html/index.html">doxygen</a> file talks about the software.</p>
