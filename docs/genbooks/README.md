# OSIS Genbooks Talk


This small portion of the repository supports a Wikipedia [talk](https://wiki.crosswire.org/Talk:OSIS_Genbooks) page on general books for the SWORD project. This example is not a complete, but attempted to build upon the existing Wikipedia article. It builds a little by including the files output by xml2gbs program, reformatting the output into a zip file, and testing an install.

The bishop app had been acquired from Google play and was used to try an install. The bishop app's library installer expected a zip file and the repo includes it - tutorial.zip. This zip file was built in different stages according to the shell script named 0. After the zip file was made, it was successfully installed to the bishop app using the library option and advanced installation sub-option.

The file is incomplete because no table of contents was observed in the bishop app. Other general book modules like the Baptist Confession of Faith of 1689 had a table of contents.
