<h2>Wikipedia Talk page</h2>

<p>The files and directories here are part of a Wikipedia [talk](https://wiki.crosswire.org/Talk:OSIS_Genbooks) page on general books for SWORD (bible) projects.</p>

<p>This example is believed to be partial, and not a complete general book module, and was copied from the Wikipedia article. The bishop app installer expected a zip file (tutorial.zip included). The zip file was built in different stages according to the shell script named 0. After the zip file was made, it was installed to the bishop app using the advanced installation option, but no table of contents was observed. Other general book modules like the Baptist Confession of Faith of 1689 had a table of contents.</p>
